KeyDot is a high-performance, command-line utility designed to extract encryption keys and detect the engine version from compiled Godot Engine games. It operates directly on game executables (Windows x64) and WebAssembly (`.wasm`) files without ever needing to run the game.

## Key Features

-   **‚ö° Blazing Fast Extraction:** Optimized C++ code and memory-mapped I/O provide results in milliseconds.
-   **üî¨ Static Analysis:** Reads the game files directly. No runtime process attachment, memory dumping, or debugging required, making it safe and efficient.
-   **üß† Memory-Efficient:** Uses memory-mapped files to let the operating system handle efficient file paging, keeping memory usage low even for huge executables.
-   **üåê WASM Support:** The only static analysis tool currently available that can extract keys from Godot games compiled for the web.

## Performance Comparison

KeyDot was built from the ground up for speed and ease of use. Here's how it compares to other available tools:

¬π **Standalone** means the tool does not require running the game or using other complex software like debuggers or disassemblers.
¬≤ **Windows speed** tested on a 78MB executable for KeyDot and a 56MB executable for GodotPCKExplorer.
¬≥ **WASM speed** tested on a 38MB `.wasm` file.

## Supported Platforms

-   ‚úÖ **Windows** (64-bit PE Executables)
-   ‚úÖ **WebAssembly** (`.wasm` files)
-   *Linux (ELF) and macOS (Mach-O) support is planned.*

## Installation

### 1. Pre-compiled Releases (Recommended)

The easiest way to use KeyDot is to download the latest pre-compiled executable for your platform from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/KeyDot/releases).

### 2. Building from Source

If you prefer to build the project yourself, you will need a C++20 compatible compiler and CMake.

**Prerequisites:**
-   CMake 3.14+
-   A C++20 Compiler (Visual Studio 2022, GCC 11+, Clang 12+)

**Steps:**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/KeyDot.git
    cd KeyDot
    ```
2.  Create a build directory:
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
3.  Configure and generate build files (example for Visual Studio):
    ```sh
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    ```
4.  Compile the project:
    ```sh
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```
The final executable, `keydot.exe`, will be in the `build/Release` directory.

## Usage

KeyDot is a simple command-line tool.

```
KeyDot - Blazingly Fast, Static Godot Engine Encryption Key Extractor
Note: Only 64-bit (x64) executables are supported at the moment.

Usage:
  KeyDot [options] <path-to-exe-or-wasm>

Options:
  -d, --debug       Enable detailed debug logging
  -t, --timers      Show execution time for each stage
  -h, --help        Show this help message and exit
```

### Examples

**1. Analyze a Windows Executable:**
```sh
keydot.exe game.exe
```
*Expected Output:*
```

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a game where KeyDot fails to extract the key, or if you want to request support for a new platform (like Linux or macOS), please **open an issue**.

Make sure to include:
1.  The sample game file (or a link to it).
2.  The **full text output** of running KeyDot with the `--debug` flag.

## Extraction Approach

### Windows (PE Files)

1.  **Find Anchor String:** The process begins by searching for known error strings related to encrypted PCK loading (e.g., `"Can't open encrypted pack directory."`) within the (`.rdata`).
2.  **Locate Code Reference:** Once a string is located, the tool scans the (`.text`) to find where this string is referenced by an instruction, typically `LEA`.
3.  **Identify Key Pointer:** Within a small window of instructions following the `LEA`, the scanner looks for a crucial pattern: a `MOV` instruction that loads a 64-bit pointer from a global address (`MOV RAX, [RIP + offset]`).
4.  **Dereference Pointer:** This global address contains a *pointer to* the actual 32-byte encryption key blob, which typically resides in the `.data` section.
5.  **Extract Key:** The tool reads the 32-byte blob from this final address, revealing the key.

### WebAssembly (.wasm)

1.  **Heuristic Search:** Godot's export template for WASM often embeds the encryption key as a raw byte array near the end of the file.
2.  **Marker Identification:** KeyDot reads the last few kilobytes of the file and searches for a specific 7-byte "start marker" followed by a 4-byte "end marker".
3.  **Key Extraction:** The 32-byte encryption key is consistently located immediately preceding this end marker.
